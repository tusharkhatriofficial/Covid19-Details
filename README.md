<p>In these hard times, It is even harder to get right data at the right time. 
<br>Now looking at the situation I felt like creating this application.
<strong>Covid19 <br>Details</strong> app makes it easier for users to track the total number of rising <br>Covid cases.</p>

<h2>Fun Fact!</h2>
<p><strong>App was suspended by Google. In order to list a health related app Google asks for some extra permissions.<br>Read about them below:</strong></p>

Verified health apps: Eligible for usage of COVID-19 related titles, icons, and marketing in Google Play store listings

In the interest of protecting user safety, only official Governmental apps and the following categories of apps are eligible to use COVID-19 or other related keywords and marketing in their Google Play store app title and app icon:

<ol>
<li>Official governmental apps as defined in section (1) above, or</li>
<li>Apps published by or in direct affiliation with:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>a healthcare system or provider (e.g., CVS Health, UK National Health Service, UnitedHealth Group, Kaiser Permanente, French national healthcare system, Netcare (South Africa), One Medical, etc.);</li>
  
<li>a nationally recognized medical or epidemiological research organization deeply rooted in medical research (including nationally recognized medical schools). (The medical or epidemiological research organization or government research, should have approval from a registered governing body (for example, Institutional Review Board in the US, or the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK). In case of dispute, a local or national government, or verifiable healthcare non-governmental organization (NGO) endorsement will be required.
</li>
</ul>

Please note for apps to meet the criteria in sub-section (b) above, the app must be directly published by or in direct partnership with the one of the entities (e.g., the authorizing institution or organization is referenced, with full permission, in the appâ€™s title, logo, or Google Play store description). Endorsement by a non-government entity alone does not meet the qualification. (e.g., an app endorsed by staff at a medical school would not qualify if that app is not published by or in direct partnership with the medical school).
